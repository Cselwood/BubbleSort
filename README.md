# Sorting Algorithms

Written in Java, I am re-exploring the algorithms I learned at University, starting with basic sorting and making my 
way back to advanced data structures.

## What and Why

BubbleSorting is an extremely simple sorting algorithm, that was my young programming self's first port-of-call for sorting any array of integers (like many of us). It boasts an inefficient BigO(n^2), with an average performance that is also quadratic. In this example, I used an array of 100 numbers to keep things simple, and that means the best case scenario for this algorithm is a linear performance, requiring all numbers to be already sorted (not likely). 

## Release History
